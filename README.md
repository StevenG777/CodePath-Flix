### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

(1) I still have time connecting the Table View object from Main storyboard to the view controller file. For example, the connection is not complete and it left a empty circle instead.

(2) I have difficulty install Cocoapot using Brew. I think it's because of the user priviledge
